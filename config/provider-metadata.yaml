        description: Provides an OpenSearch Dashboards object resource. This resource interacts directly with the underlying OpenSearch index backing Dashboards, so the format must match what Dashboards the version of Dashboards is expecting. Dashboards with older versions - directly pulling the JSON from a Dashboards index of the same version of OpenSearch targeted by the provider is a workaround.
